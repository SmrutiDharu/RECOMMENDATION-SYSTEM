DESCRITPION OF TASK: RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
#PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering with matrix factorization techniques. The goal of the system is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on historical rating data. Instead of relying on movie content or metadata, the system learns latent patterns from user–item interactions to predict how a user might rate unseen movies.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end recommendation pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, rating prediction, recommendation generation, and performance evaluation using standard metrics.

#DATASET USED:

Dataset Name: MovieLens 100K

Source: GroupLens Research

Description:

100,000 movie ratings

943 users

1,682 movies

The dataset consists of user IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and timestamps. Movie metadata (titles and release years) is used only for displaying recommendation results, not for training.

# TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Programming Language
Python 3

Libraries & Frameworks
NumPy – numerical computations
Pandas – data manipulation and preprocessing
Scikit-learn – TruncatedSVD for matrix factorization
Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) – data visualization

Development Environment
Jupyter Notebook – interactive development and experimentation
Anaconda Distribution – environment and package management

Editor / Platform
Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda / VS Code / JupyterLab)
GitHub – version control and project hosting

#EVALUATION METRICS:
RMSE: Measures the square root of the average squared prediction error

MAE: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual ratings

These metrics provide insight into how well the model predicts user preferences.
